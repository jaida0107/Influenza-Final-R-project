## EPID 7500 Final

**Abstract**

As the 1918 flu swept through America, New York was heavily impacted by the pandemic. We must continue to watch over the incidence of influenza in New York. Through this, we can draw future predictions to use mitigating strategies for the citizens of New York.  

**Background**

	Influenza has affected the world for over a century. With the start of the 1918 influenza pandemic, the United States along with the world have been negatively impacted by the virus in multiple ways. This impact has continued into today with every year having a new season with different measures and predictions. As the world continues to combat the SARS-COV-2 pandemic and enters into the flu season, we must analyze how to prepare for the flu season. Due to New York’s population capacity and unexpected rates for last flu season, monitoring this flu season can be integral in protecting the health of all New York citizens.
	
	To understand the gravity of influenza, one must know the history of influenza. In fact, influenza has been reported to be first documented by Hippocrates (Pappas, et al, 2008). Despite Hippocrates' discovery, there was not a documented report of a flu pandemic until 1918. The influenza pandemic of 1918 was first recognized in the spring, and the virus swept through America in March 1918 with this being the first major flu pandemic  (PHMC, n.d.). As this pandemic escalated, there were countless deaths. Although the 1918 influenza pandemic ended 2 years later, it taught the world many different lessons including how to attempt to address pandemics. Despite its ending, influenza has continued to impact the world today as we experience different flu seasons every year. The estimates for the average number of deaths are 400,000 deaths per year but can range from 294,000 up to 518,00 deaths per year (Ritchie, 2020).  There are also different versions of influenza. There are  two main types of influenza that are responsible for the seasonal flu, which are Influenza A and influenza B. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Influenza A has two different subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) while Influenza B has sublineages (Victoria and Yahmataga) (CDC, 2021b).  With these main types of the influenza, there have been control measures that have been set in place to control influenza.
	
Therefore, influenza is a global threat. With this threat being acknowledged, there are also areas that have higher cases of influenza.  For example, in the United States, there are states that have high rates of influenza. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), some of the top states with higher incidence and mortality rates of influenza include Hawaii, Mississippi, Tennessee, and New York. (CDC, 2021a) . With New York being the fourth state with the highest rate of influenza related mortalities , it is important to understand the trends of the influenza virus. It is also important to monitor the flu in New York city to control and hopefully prevent a significant rate of mortalities. 

Moreover, due to New York  being one of the top states for travel and with the state being found as the epi-center of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is integral to understand how viruses such as the flu are affecting the state(ShareAmerica, 2019;  James et. al, 2020). With this analysis, it can help to understand how the flu may affect other states. These analyses can depend on different factors. The flu season can vary every year, and has been especially variant during the COVID-19 pandemic; there were record low numbers of COVID-19 cases, but this can leave individual’s immune systems to  not recognize the influenza strains and in turn cause the virus to produce more severe disease (World Health Organization, 2021; Kaushal, 2021).  Thus, it is crucial to predict what the flu season will entail for this upcoming year in New York and thus other states in the United States of America.

**Results**

By epidemiological analysis via an epidemic curve, figure 1’s first plot (a) shows that the region with the most cases was New York city with over 1,000 cases. The metro and western districts have similar incidences of cases while the capital district has the least amount of cases. The bottom of figure 1 (b) shows the incidence of cases in New York based on the influenza type. The figure depicts that the type of influenza that is the most prominent in New York is tied between influenza A and Influenza B overall. However, every flu season differs. The number of flu cases was higher for the majority of the years for Influenza A, but Influenza B and influenza A were closely tied in 2020. 

As for figure 2, it depicts a future prediction of the influenza seasons.  The figure is an interactive model that shows the actual and predicted number of cases in New York from 2009-2020. Then the model predicts the influenza seasons for 2021- 2022 and 2022-2023. According to the model, the influenza season for 2021-2022 will be similar to 2020-2021 with a peak in cases happening around late January and early February. 

	Therefore, figure 2 can help to make decisions on how to handle the upcoming influenza season, but also there are some limitations to consider about the prediction model.  With this prediction model, we can see that the influenza season is expected to not have a drastic amount of cases. However, if control measures for influenza are not established, there will still be a peak of influenza cases in New York at the beginning of 2022. As for the limitations of this model, the R package that was utilized, prophet, is more efficient when population sizes are smaller. With this consideration, the size of the population was adjusted to a sample size of 35%. Moreover, the model combines some of the influenza cases of 2019 into the influenza season of 2020-2021, which causes the graph to appear that more cases occurred in 2020. Due to these limitations, cases may be higher in 2022 than what has been shown. Thus, we must carefully monitor influenza as we enter into a month where influenza cases are expected to rise.

**Conclusion**

Being able to predict the upcoming influenza seasons for New York can help to better understand how to protect the citizens of New York along with the rest of the United States. Influenza has affected the world for centuries, and has continued to impact various parts of the world including the United States. There are states that have higher incidence of influenza such as New York. The state of New York is particularly important when monitoring the influenza season due to its high travel volume as well as being the epicenter for transmission of other viruses such as SARS-COV-2. By plotting the incidence of cases in various regions of New York along with the prediction model, a prediction can be made that influenza should still be a virus to monitor in New York especially in regions with higher incidences of cases such as New York city. With this monitoring, the influenza season can hopefully be controlled before it affects a large number of Americans.
